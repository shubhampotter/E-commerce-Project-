-In this project ,you will analyze and segment the customer of an e-commerce company by using  RFM approach.

-This will enable the e-commerce company to optimize their retention and acquisition strategies. 





## Market Outlook
 
E-commerce stores which became success stories were successful in targeting the desired customers. One of the techniques by which they were able to achieve this was customer segmentation i.e. by segmenting the existing customers based on frequency of purchases, monetary value etc. E-commerce stores who designed market strategies based on mass marketing soon realized the need of customer segmentation as an alternative to save cost and efforts in the digital sphere. In a real-world segmentation scenario, there might be hundreds of variables which can be used but broadly they segment the customers by the following characteristics:
## Overview of the problem 

You have been provided with a single file which contains data related to the ecommerce transactions. This data contains the date-time of sale, customer shipping location, and price of single unit from 2016 to 2017.

## Data and Problem Detail 

Your organization has asked you to draw meaningful insights from 2 years of data & provide brief details based on the monetary value, frequency of buy, etc. 
## Objective

Build an unsupervised learning model which can enable your company to analyze their customers via RFM (Recency, Frequency and Monetary value) approach.

## Steps to be followed:

1. Understand the problem and objectives 

2. Understand the data & develop some business sense

3. EDA (if you require in this case) 

4. Provide the results and understanding you got by performing exploratory data analysis. 
5. Data Cleaning 
6. Model building (trying unsupervised learning model) 
7. Grouping the customer based on their performance.
8. Show the distribution of the Customers and merge to the data.

## Important Libraries

1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Seaborn
4. Matplotlib
5. sklearn
6. squarify
